Here is the link to play the game:  https://indrajanambiar.com/game.io/

The game randomly selects a word from a pre-defined list of words and the player has to guess the word by entering letters or the entire word 
into an input field. If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed and the input field and button are disabled. 
If the guess is incorrect, the game will decrement the number of remaining guesses, update the displayed message to inform the player, 
and continue until the player runs out of guesses or correctly guesses the word.
The player can reset the game by clicking the reset button, which will choose a new random word and reset the game state.
